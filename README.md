Interfacing MCP2515 CAN Controller for Efficient Data Exchange Between ECUs

Overview

This project implements a CAN (Controller Area Network) bus communication system using Arduino boards and MCP2515 CAN modules. The system is designed to facilitate efficient and reliable data exchange between Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in automotive environments. The system includes three ECUs: Arduino UNO, Arduino Nano, and Arduino Mega, each interfaced with MCP2515 CAN modules. The readings are displayed using free online visualization tools.
